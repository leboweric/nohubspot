# Office 365 Integration Request for CRM Application

## Subject: Azure AD App Registration Request for CRM Email Integration

Dear [Vendor Name],

We are developing a customer relationship management (CRM) system and need to integrate it with our Office 365 environment to enable email tracking and synchronization. We're requesting assistance in setting up the necessary Azure AD application registration and API permissions.

## Business Requirements

Our CRM needs to:
- Read emails from user mailboxes to track customer conversations
- Organize emails into conversation threads by customer
- Send emails on behalf of users that appear in their Sent folder
- Track email engagement (opens/clicks) for emails sent through the CRM

This integration will allow our sales team to work seamlessly between Outlook and our CRM, with all customer communications properly tracked and organized.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Azure AD Application Registration
- **Application Name**: NoHubSpot CRM Email Integration
- **Application Type**: Web application
- **Redirect URI**: `https://nohubspot-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/microsoft/callback`
- **Supported Account Types**: Accounts in this organizational directory only

### 2. API Permissions Required
Please configure the following Microsoft Graph API delegated permissions:
- `Mail.Read` - Read user mail
- `Mail.ReadWrite` - Read and write user mail
- `Mail.Send` - Send mail as the user
- `User.Read` - Sign in and read user profile
- `offline_access` - Maintain access to data

**Note**: These should be configured as "Delegated permissions" that require user consent, not application permissions.

### 3. Authentication Configuration
- Enable OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow
- Generate a client secret with 2-year expiration
- Configure proper consent settings to allow users to authorize individually

### 4. Information Needed
Once configured, we'll need:
- **Application (Client) ID**
- **Directory (Tenant) ID**
- **Client Secret Value**
- **OAuth 2.0 Authorization Endpoint**
- **OAuth 2.0 Token Endpoint**

## Security Considerations

- Users will individually consent to permissions when connecting their account
- Access tokens will be securely stored and refreshed as needed
- Users can revoke access at any time through their Microsoft account settings
- All API communications will use HTTPS
- We'll implement proper token refresh handling

## Implementation Timeline

We're looking to implement this integration within the next [timeframe]. Please let us know if you need any additional information or have questions about our requirements.

This is a standard OAuth2 integration similar to how other CRM platforms (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.) integrate with Office 365. We're happy to discuss any security concerns or compliance requirements you may have.

Thank you for your assistance with this request.

Best regards,

## Additional Technical Details (if requested)

### OAuth2 Flow
1. User clicks "Connect Office 365" in our CRM
2. Redirected to Microsoft login page
3. User authenticates and consents to permissions
4. Microsoft redirects back with authorization code
5. Our app exchanges code for access/refresh tokens
6. Tokens used to access Microsoft Graph API

### API Usage
- **Email Sync**: Poll `/me/messages` endpoint every 5 minutes
- **Send Email**: POST to `/me/sendMail` endpoint
- **Thread Matching**: Use conversation ID and subject matching
- **Attachment Handling**: Download via `/messages/{id}/attachments`

### Rate Limits
We'll implement appropriate throttling to stay within Microsoft Graph API limits:
- Batch requests where possible
- Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors
- Cache data appropriately to minimize API calls
